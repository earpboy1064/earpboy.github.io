						<p>In describing computers, a distinction is often made between computer architecture
							and computer organization. Although it is difficult to give precise definitions
							for these terms, a consensus exists about the general areas covered by each. For
							example, see [VRAN80], [SIEW82], and [BELL78a]; an interesting alternative view
							is presented in [REDD76].
							Computer architecture refers to those attributes of a system visible to a programmer
							or, put another way, those attributes that have a direct impact on the
							logical execution of a program. A term that is often used interchangeably with computer
							architecture is instruction set architecture (ISA). The ISA defines instruction
							formats, instruction opcodes, registers, instruction and data memory; the effect of
							executed instructions on the registers and memory; and an algorithm for controlling
							instruction execution. Computer organization refers to the operational units
							and their interconnections that realize the architectural specifications. Examples of
							architectural attributes include the instruction set, the number of bits used to represent
							various data types (e.g., numbers, characters), I/O mechanisms, and techniques
							for addressing memory. Organizational attributes include those hardware details
							transparent to the programmer, such as control signals; interfaces between the computer
							and peripherals; and the memory technology used.
							For example, it is an architectural design issue whether a computer will have
							a multiply instruction. It is an organizational issue whether that instruction will be
							implemented by a special multiply unit or by a mechanism that makes repeated
							use of the add unit of the system. The organizational decision may be based on the
							anticipated frequency of use of the multiply instruction, the relative speed of the
							two approaches, and the cost and physical size of a special multiply unit.
							Historically, and still today, the distinction between architecture and organization
							has been an important one. Many computer manufacturers offer a family of
							computer models, all with the same architecture but with differences in organization.
							Consequently, the different models in the family have different price and performance
							characteristics. Furthermore, a particular architecture may span many years
							and encompass a number of different computer models, its organization changing
							with changing technology. A prominent example of both these phenomena is the
							IBM System/370 architecture. This architecture was first introduced in 1970 and<br>
